# MOJITO

MOJITO is a modern cocktail-themed landing page that captures the premium atmosphere of an upscale cocktail lounge through stunning animations and sleek design.

This project was originally built as a follow-along from [GSAP Web Animations Course by JSMastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW1yfBKRMKc&t=8424s), but instead of only copying the tutorial, I took it further by debugging issues, refining the overall code structure, and adding additional animations to make the interface feel more engaging and dynamic.

The result is a clean, responsive, and interactive cocktail page that not only demonstrates my ability to follow technical guidance but also shows how I can improve, adapt, and polish existing codebases.
